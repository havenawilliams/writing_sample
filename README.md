# writing_sample
A simple writing sample of a statistical workflow that includes multiple model building and evaluation techniques including:

∙Power analysis (including required sample size calculator for test power)

∙Fake data generation

∙Bayesian general linear model with custom priors

∙Summary statistics

∙MCMC interval polotting

∙LOO Cross validation

∙Posterior predictive density checking

∙Type S error evaluation

∙Type M error evaluation


Thank you very much and I hope to have more statistical analyses up soon!
